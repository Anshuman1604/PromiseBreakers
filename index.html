			<h3>What are we?</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="purpose">
			<p>PB, an acronym for "Promise Breakers" is the association of 4 bizarre personas who happen to be completely different from each other.  However, these differences were overpowered by the commonality they hold whenever it comes to dealing with emotions, perceiving certain situations, or judging persons. Before it's formation, there weren't any regular meet-ups or discussions among the members. With the first talk of the group being about an unnatural relationship, we started sharing almost everything with each other. Be it be waiting for others after classes or hanging out irrespective of the deadlines and time of the day, we started prioritizing their bond over a number of things. Numerous fights and arguments couldn't shake our bond even a bit and we just ultimately end up pulling each other's leg and caring more for each other. Even on being called Pervert, the members don't back out to Make new partners each sem while working on the project Gas solutions and Playing FIFA in the free time. We Ignore each other's mistakes and continue loving each other No Matter what or else it's a matter of Lajjya. We will undoubtedly prove that our friendship will remain young forever even when we turn Buddha-Buddhi.

        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">There we go!! That's the first photo I remember we took as a group. Also, this was the first photo taken in my new phone (Redmi Note 5 pro). Inside the main building, we tried out all the different modes of photography availaible, including a slow-mo video to capture the expressions of Ashrita.</p>

        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">A trip to Ved-Vyas, filled with lot of stoppages such as searching for the final scooty, puncturing of DPM's scooty or the dust through which we had to go to reach our destination. Also, this day Swostik became our baby. </p>

        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">That time of the year when we all flaunt our traditional dresses. After worshipping Sarawati, we all go to our own way of enjoying the rest of the time by strolling here and there.

        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">Finally Vivid came. We went to visit this in RM Hall even one month before the actual date. Any event in college, we always used to go together even though we would have visited it earlier.</p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">April 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> This place has a special place in our heart's. Every other day, you can hear us saying lets go the grub on th run today after the class. Really miss those shakes and the place. Only downside was the distance from our hostel, so we needed to find vehicles to go on our own. Wish we can all gp this place for one more time.</p>

        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> Meet the new loves of Ashrita and Swostik and whatever rest happened in Canada stays in Cannada, so can't discuss about those (The most notable incident was with swostik in a rainy night).

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">May-July 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">It was like a ritual to have a video call once in the morning and again in the evening or night. There were lots of hot topics that were being discussed everyday, including the new love stories in Canada and other censored topics.Lots of calls, lots of screenshot and lots of fun.With that, our group PB was created officially and we did what our group name means.</p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Sept 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> All of us wearing our favourite characters from GOT. Made both of them to wait with me the whole day during the process, and in return they got pass to guest house. But one of them was not called(Swostik) as I had only 2 pass.</p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Sept 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> Since swostik was not called, he was angry on all of us. To make him happy, we planned this late night photoshoot that night only. After lots of convincing, finally Swostik came. He is behind the lens in this picture.</p>

    			<div class="timeline-item" data-text="NIT Main Building">

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Sept 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> Finally,there comes Swostik.Took 1-2 hrs to convince him to come from his room to this place to click photos. Late night roaming, taking pics, chattering around, it was so much of fun. I never knew about the time when I was with these guys.</p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Sept 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> The place where we used to go to drink milkshake and spend time with all after the classes. Used to eat here only on the occassions of Puja. This place was closest to our rooms and you can see Swostik walking only in his underwear in the balcony from this place.Though we didn't like the food, we have many memories associated with this place.(Hitting the restaurant with our football from corridor; throwing away wastes at night towards it) </p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Sept 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">The hi-fi place for treats and a pic in this background is a mandatory one for whoever visits CP. We used to go there to eat desserts normally, brownies and choco la petite being the common ones. A funny memorable incident associated with this place is the after-effects felt by Ashrita after eating so much of chocolate. That is why she is also called as Hag***.</p>

    			<div class="timeline-item" data-text="Dispensary">
    		  		<div class="timeline__content"><img class="timeline__img" src="memories/18.jpeg"/>
        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Oct 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">The only time I guess rout went to dispensary, that too only to get a Volini. As Rout had to wait in a long queue, rest of us passed our time by clicking photos and doing the usual jokes about each other.</p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Oct 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> This was the only time we all celebrated Diwali.I never used to celebrate Diwali due to my health problems but I won't regret celebrating this one time. We had lots of fun and rest is the magic of the DSLR prime lens. Swostik was not with us initially as he was busy with someone else at some secret place.(Can't reveal the name as it is a secret although Swostik's name is added with almost all the girls in NITR)</p>
      				</div>

    		  		<div class="timeline__content"><img class="timeline__img" src="memories/23.jpeg"/>
        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Oct 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> Standing in between two places that are so important to me in different ways. Infront of the BBA, Rout and I met Ashrita for the first time, and rest is history. The other place is Rengcol, I don't have the count about the number of times we had went to this place after the classes just to eat something and discuss about our day.</p>

    		  		<div class="timeline__content"><img class="timeline__img" src="memories/24.jpeg"/>
        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Nov 19</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> This photo is a proof that Ashrita can also take some good pics. For some reason, I feel all of us are looking like superheroes in this picture. And indeed they have been my superheroes over my 4 years of journey in the college. Without them, college life wouldn't have been college.</p>
      				</div>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Jan 20</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> The event which features so many different dance forms. But we never went there to watch any dance, we used to go only to eat at the food stall and click some good pics. Sadly, this pic is our last pic in a ethnic outfit.(The last pic would have been in Grand Farewell)</p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Feb 20</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc"> Last 1-2 months, we all used to gather at this place after dinner just to have gossips. Many scandals have happened in this place like the case of Out of the Loop and persuading Ashrita to not to be angry upon me. We had a lot of memories at that place and around that place(Amul, Rangoli, Gupchup shop, Joz).</p>
      				</div>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Feb 20</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">Used to go to classes only if after the class or in the gap time we can all meet. This is the only reason I used to wake up early , else I wake up normally around 12. In the gaps, we used to go and eat Dahibara Aloodum (Chicken-Dahibara) or eat icecream at Amul. </p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Feb 20</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">The most common place we used to go to eat dinner. We have went there uncountable times for different reasons at different time. Also, there is a fact that it is impossible to control Ashrita infront of Hex (the reason of uncontrolness can't be said). In this pic, you can see an expert of Deep Learning, who loves it so much that he got a deep learning dress as well.</p>

        				<h2 class="timeline__content-title">Feb 20</h2>
        				<p class="timeline__content-desc">The last group photo we have. Due to this ongoing pandemic, college got ended early for us and we couldn't have anything as a planned oneLastTime. No farewell, No Goodbyes, No Hugs , nothing. But I will forever cherish the moments I spent with these guys even though it was cut short by 2 months, but our friendship will never get compromised. Hoping to meet again really soon.</p>
